This repository is a place to store ideas, resources, or even share and discuss things with others.  A repository in general can contain folders and files, images, videos, spreadsheets, and data sets â€“ anything a project needs.

Hi Everyone,
I am familiarizing myself with Github to possibly take on the roll of Product Manager for the BlockSpaces Procurant project.  The skills I acquire working on the project will be a tremendous professional benefit.
